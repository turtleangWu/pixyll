It is my sixth month in Copenhagen, Denmark. A little bit different from Taiwan, people here have a great and tight connection with each other that we usually have lunch and a coffee break every day. Moreover, we have some more social activities, including playing board games, doing sports, or just having some random talks to the colleagues in the park on Friday night. There are just so many occasions that we can chat with people, and the topics range broadly. It is during this period that I realize how limited I am able to introduce my home country to others and how limited I know about countries out of east Asia. Therefore, I decide to make some posts in English about Taiwan, and also some topics I have frequently talked to the others in my daily life here. I believe that being able to introduce one’s home country as well as one’s personalities confidently and fluently in English will make one’s life in the foreign countries much easier.
