I’m Yi-Shan Wu, currently a research assistant under the supervision of Dr. [Chi-Jen Lu](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/cjlu/) at [Institute of Information Science (IIS), Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/index_zh.html). My research interest is theoretical machine learning, and in particular, online learning and some generalization issues in deep learning.

For online learning, I’m now working on the problem of Lifelong Learning, which could be seen as natural generalization of online optimization but includes more than one task. The goal is to understand how good regret bounds can be if certain knowledge is shared among tasks.

I’m also enthralled by problems in several aspects of deep learning, and in particular, the reason why a well-trained neural network can generalize well and why some algorithms such as SGD returns better solutions. I’m now working on a project about understanding how dropout or some other kinds of “noise" methods help improving generalization. Furthermore, I’m trying to figure out if there is any commonality among several approaches to prove generalization bound, such as stability, compression, mutual information, and etc.

This is my blog about some new research issues in machine learning. I insist on writing in Chinese as there are already a great amount of resources written in English. I wish more young students in Taiwan can also be interested in theoretical machine learning problems and know there is some guy who is willing to exchange ideas with them.

我是吳宜珊﹝Yi-Shan Wu﹞，目前擔任中央研究院資訊所呂及人老師的研究助理。目前興趣是理論方面的機器學習問題，主要研究題目是有關『線上決策問題』﹝online learning ﹞、『普遍化問題』﹝deep learning generalization issues﹞，但也關心各式各樣有關機器學習的理論分析，尤其對現存模型或演算法的『限制』特別感興趣。

這個網誌紀錄我當助理以來學習的東西，主要希望用中文整理關於機器學習相關的理論，或許還有一些相關的論文。特別強調是中文是因為，在學習的路上看到很多同伴，學習能力可能好過我，但卻受限於英文能力而比別人辛苦；且目前難看到有中文的理論教科書或是科普文章，雖然已經比以前好一些了，但對新知的捕捉依然緩慢。

希望這篇網誌幫助我記憶、整理曾經知道的事情，或許也讓有興趣的人能來看看。更希望更多不同領域、能力比我好多的人也能分享學到的事情。有興趣、或是發現文章哪裡有錯誤的人，請不吝寫信交流。E-mail : turtleangwu@iis.sinica.edu.tw
