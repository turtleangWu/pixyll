I’m 吳宜珊﹝Yi-Shan Wu﹞, currently a research assistant under the supervision of Dr. [Chi-Jen Lu](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/pages/cjlu/) at [Institute of Information Science (IIS), Academia Sinica](https://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/index_zh.html). My research interest is theoretical machine learning, and in particular, online learning and some generalization issues in deep learning.

For online learning, I’m now working on the problem of Lifelong Learning, which could be seen as natural generalization of online optimization but includes more than one task. The goal is to understand how good regret bounds can be if certain knowledge is shared among tasks.

I’m also enthralled by problems in several aspects of deep learning, and in particular, the reason why a well-trained neural network can generalize well. I’m now working on a project about understanding how dropout or some other kinds of “noise" methods help improving generalization. Furthermore, I’m trying to figure out if there is any commonality among several approaches to prove generalization bound, such as stability, compression, mutual information, and etc.

This is my blog about some new research issues in machine learning. This blog is mainly written in English while my wordpress blog contains materials written in Chinese. I wish more young students in Taiwan can also be interested in theoretical machine learning problems and know there is some guy who is willing to exchange ideas with them.
